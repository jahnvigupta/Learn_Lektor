Creative Commons has been building free software for over a decade to support our mission of maximizing digital creativity, sharing, and innovation. We work on products that, among other things, make applying CC licenses to content easier, help users find CC licensed content easily, promote and educate users about CC licenses and copyright, and connect the global CC community. Our projects come in all sizes and shapes, from several simple static websites to making the 1.6 billion+ Creative Commons works currently available on the internet searchable.
